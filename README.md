# Local-Good-Inventory

Project description: Local Good Center is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving the community through their

for the community members coming to the food pantry of Local Good Center. The team is divided into two subteams, each dedicated
to working on the front-end and back-end side of the website. The Spring 2022 team will focus on documenting all the requirements
for the project through discussing with the Local Good Center representative and consulting the EPICS advisors. Then the team will

aspects of the design to construct a basic prototype of the website by the end of the semester.
